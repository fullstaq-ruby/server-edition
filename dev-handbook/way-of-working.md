# Way of working

## Development process

 * Never push to the `main` branch directly, except for trivial documentation updates.

   - Instead, propose most changes through pull requests.

 * The person who merges a pull request is responsible for testing it after merge, and for providing feedback to the submitter if something is wrong.

 * Write [joyous commit messages](https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/write-joyous-git-commit-messages-2f98891114c4).

 * Strive to respond to pull requests in 48h, in order to encourage contributions.

## Communication

We communicate publicly as much as possible. All such public communication happens through [our issue tracker](https://github.com/fullstaq-ruby/server-edition/issues) and our [discussion forum](https://github.com/fullstaq-ruby/server-edition/discussions), so be sure to subscribe for notifications.
