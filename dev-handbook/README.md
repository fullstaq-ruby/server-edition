# Development handbook

## Concepts

### Core concepts

 * [The "minimal dependencies" principle & the use of Docker](minimal-dependencies-principle.md) — on the fact that we don't require many dependencies to be installed on the local machine, and that instead we use dependencies through Docker.
 * [Package organization](package-organization.md) — which package types exist, what they are for, and how they relate to each other.
 * [Build steps](build-steps.md) — what steps are involved in order to build packages, and how they relate to each other.
 * [Build workflow management](build-workflow-management.md) — how we manage the fact that we have to build packages for multiple distributions, variants and Ruby versions.
 * [Build environments](build-environments.md) — how we utilize Docker images to build packages for different distributions and for running tasks.
 * [Source organization](source-organization.md) — how the Git repository is organized, and which files serve what purpose.

### Advanced concepts

 * [CI/CD system resumption support](ci-cd-resumption.md)
 * [CI/CD system and splitting into multiple workflows](ci-cd-split-multiple-workflows.md)
